## Introduction

It's with great pleasure to announce that we have ported ComplianceAsCode/content workshops into our main [repository](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content). These workshops have been delivered
across conferences such as Red Hat Summit and [Devconf.cz](https://devconfcz2021.sched.com/event/gmSq/creating-content-for-automated-security-compliance) ([Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bE-X2YBrNk)) for example.

They are now much simpler to setup and you can do that only with the push of a button!

They are a great starting point for newcomers to the project, but they can also teach experts new things.

The workshops take advantage of the [`gitpod.io`](https://www.gitpod.io/) integration (see this [blogpost]([blogpost](https://complianceascode.github.io/template/2022/06/30/gitpod-integration.html)) for more details),
so you are only required to have a Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket account to be able to spin up a fully working workshop environment on you web browser.

## How to Access the Workshops

You go to this file [docs/workshop/README.adoc](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/master/docs/workshop/README.adoc).

Select the exercise you want to do, click the link to spin up the environment, wait until it finishes all the setup steps. For example:

![Workshop Environment for Exercise Number 1](/assets/img/workshop_env_link.png)

Then you can start following the documentation of that specific exercise and running commands on your web browser environment.

The exercises have a thought learning structure, but you can definitely do them in any order as they do not have any dependencies with each other,
apart from concepts introduced that help you build the knowledge.

## Feedback is Always Welcomed

If you find any issues with the workshop, feel free to create an issue on this [page](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/issues).

Any suggestions on how to improve or new ideas for exercises you can submit in a form of discussion on this [page](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/discussions).
