With a bit more than one thousand commits since last release we are happy to announce that ComplianceAsCode / Content v0.1.58 was [released](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/releases/tag/v0.1.58) on September 24th, 2021.

## Highlight of this release

The project now supports another checking engine: [Script Checking Engine (SCE)](https://www.open-scap.org/features/other-standards/sce/).
By default, the content is built without SCE checks, check [Building SCE](https://complianceascode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/developer/02_building_complianceascode.html?highlight=SCE#building-sce-non-compliant-content) section in the docs, for
how to enable it.
Note that content built with SCE checks are not SCAP compliant.

## What's new in the content?

### New Profiles

Notable new profiles in this release:
- An initial version of Security Techinical Implementation Guide (STIG) for Ubuntu 20.04; and
- Center for Internet Security (CIS) for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12.

### Profile updates

Some of the profiles that were updated:

- The CIS profiles for Red Hat Enterprise Linx 8 were reorganized according to its target (workstation or server) and level (Level 1 or 2).
  Now there are 3 more profiles aligning to Workstation Level 1, Level 2, and Server Level 1.

- A significant amount of new rules was added to the STIG profile for Red Hat Enerprise Linux 8.

## What's new for content developers?

### Automated addition of CCEs

Tired of finding out that a couple of important rules doesn't have a CCE, because extracting one from a CCE pool and assigning it to a rule file is cumbersome?
The `fix_rules.py` utility has been extended, so it now automatically picks up a CCE in a CCE file, and places it right into the specified rule.

You can use it like this:

```
$ PYTHONPATH=. utils/rule_dir_json.py  # that's a general prerequisite of fix_rules
$ PYTHONPATH=. utils/fix_rules.py  --product products/rhel7/product.yml add-cce accounts_tmout 
``` 

If you try the code above, you will find out that nothing has changed - the utility is able to detect that the rule already has a RHEL7 CCE.

If you are reading it as a non-RHEL developer, the tool accepts a `--cce-pool` options, that allow introduction of another CCE files than the one in `shared/references/cce-redhat-avail.txt`.
If you would like to bring your CCEs upstream, you will just need to extend the (cce.py)[https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/master/ssg/cce.py] to integrate it with the script.


### Sorting of references and identifiers

### Migration of the shared Bash remediations functions to Jinja macros

Writing remediations is an important part of developing security content.
And although each rule addresses a single configuration change, different rules may need to run similar commands to remediate the system.
So it is only natural that the project provides a library to streamline development and reduce code duplication.

The project features two mechanisms that make Bash code available for use in remediations.
The first mechanism is the [bash_remediation_functions](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/tree/v0.1.57/shared/bash_remediation_functions).
A mechanism that makes use of the XCCDF substitution capability to inject the Bash function into the remediations, this means that OpenSCAP is used to make the substitutions and render the final remediation snippet.
This approach also requires the remediation to declare an include for the build system to transform the Bash function calls into the XCCDF substitution syntax.

The second mechanism is the [Jinja macros](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/v0.1.57/shared/macros-bash.jinja), which are expanded during the content build.

In this release a good portion of the Bash remediation functions were migrated to Jinja macros, and by the next release all of them will have been migrated.
This will leave the project with a single mechanism, which should streamline how we define and make available Bash snippets to remediations.
The expansion of snippets at build time will provide more clarity on the final remediation;
And the Jinja templating engine provides a formidable customization power, allowing the Bash snippet to be expanded differently for each product, for example.

### Development environment setup via Ansible

We have now an Ansible [role](https://galaxy.ansible.com/marcusburghardt/ansible_role_openscap) to help us to very quickly prepare a completely functional development environment. About 10 minutes are enough for Ansible to safely conclude the hard work and deliver a ready to go development environment.

This is a great option to start contributing faster, aligned with the official documentation while enjoying the automation benefits. : )
