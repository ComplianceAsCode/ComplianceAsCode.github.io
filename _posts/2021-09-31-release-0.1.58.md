I am happy to announce that ComplianceAsCode / Content v0.1.58 [has been released](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/releases/tag/v0.1.58) on TBA.

## Highlight of this release

## What's new in the content?

## What's new for content developers?


### Automated addition of CCEs

Tired of finding out that a couple of important rules doesn't have a CCE, because extracting one from a CCE pool and assigning it to a rule file is cumbersome?
The `fix_rules.py` utility has been extended, so it now automatically picks up a CCE in a CCE file, and places it right into the specified rule.

You can use it like this:

```
$ PYTHONPATH=. utils/rule_dir_json.py  # that's a general prerequisite of fix_rules
$ PYTHONPATH=. utils/fix_rules.py  --product products/rhel7/product.yml add-cce accounts_tmout 
``` 

If you try the code above, you will find out that nothing has changed - the utility is able to detect that the rule already has a RHEL7 CCE.

If you are reading it as a non-RHEL developer, the tool accepts a `--cce-pool` options, that allow introduction of another CCE files than the one in `shared/references/cce-redhat-avail.txt`.
If you would like to bring your CCEs upstream, you will just need to extend the (cce.py)[https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/master/ssg/cce.py] to integrate it with the script.


### Sorting of references and identifiers


### Development environment setup via Ansible

We now have an Ansible role to help us to very quickly prepare a completely functional development environment. About 10 minutes are enough for Ansible to safely conclude the hard work and deliver a ready to go development environment.

This is a great option to start contributing faster, aligned with the official documentation and enjoying the automation benefits. : )

More information is found in the [development documentation](https://complianceascode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/developer/02_building_complianceascode.html).
